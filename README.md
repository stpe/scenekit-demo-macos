Spawns random geometric shapes (with even more spawned by clicking the mouse). A force is applied to have them shoot up and then fall down with physics simulation for collisions.

Started off with this somewhat outdated iOS [Kodeco tutorial](https://www.kodeco.com/1261-scene-kit-tutorial-with-swift-part-1-getting-started), but fixed some deprecation related issues and extended it further.
